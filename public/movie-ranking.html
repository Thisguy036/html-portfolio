<h1>The Best Movies According to Santiago</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!!!</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I really love the story and script used in the movie. It talks about a man's escape that he was wrongly accused of. You witness the kind of corruption that he and his other cellmates experience.</p>

<h3>It's a Wonderful Life</h3>
<p>I really love this movie because it reinforces the idea of everything happens for a reason. Here we have a man that has big desires to leave his hometown and travel the world and accomplish big things, only to get sided by events in his life that have him stay. At the end, he realizes just how much of an impact he made in his marriage, kids, and the town.</p>

<h3>Top Gun:Maverick</h3>
<p>This just brings back nostalgia. I was in the navy, specifically in Naval Aviation, and it's a lot of pride to see it represented on the big screen.</p>
